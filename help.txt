Your FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL backend lives here.

main.py: Starts the FastAPI server and mounts the GraphQL route.
schema.py: Defines your GraphQL schema using Strawberry (queries, mutations, types).
requirements.txt: Lists Python packages needed for the backend (e.g., fastapi, strawberry-graphql, uvicorn).
.env: Stores sensitive config like database URLs, secret keys, etc.

‚öõÔ∏è Frontend Folder (frontend/)
Your React app powered by Vite and Apollo Client.

Core folders:
env/: Optional folder for organizing environment files (e.g., .env.development, .env.production).

node_modules/: Auto-generated by npm; contains all installed packages.

public/: Static assets served directly (e.g., favicon.ico, images).

src/ ‚Äî Your actual app code:
apollo/: Apollo Client setup (e.g., client.js configures GraphQL endpoint and cache).

graphql/: Stores GraphQL operations:

queries.js: Read operations (e.g., GET_USERS)

mutations.js: Write operations (e.g., CREATE_USER)

fragments.js: Reusable GraphQL field groups

components/: Reusable UI pieces (e.g., UserCard, Loader)

pages/: Page-level views tied to routes (e.g., Home, Users)

hooks/: Custom React hooks for logic reuse (e.g., useUsers)

styles/: CSS or Tailwind setup (e.g., global.css)

App.jsx: Root component that defines layout and routing

main.jsx: Entry point that renders <App /> and wraps it with ApolloProvider

üì¶ Frontend Config Files
package.json: Declares dependencies, scripts (npm run dev), and metadata.

package-lock.json: Locks exact versions of installed packages for consistency.

vite.config.js: Vite-specific settings (e.g., aliases, proxying to backend).

üõ†Ô∏è Project Root
.gitignore: Tells Git to ignore files/folders like node_modules, __pycache__, .env.

README.md: Documentation for your project ‚Äî setup instructions, usage, etc.
